        <h3>Description</h3>
        This course will cover concepts of programming languages: syntax, semantics, introductory type theory, functional programming, lambda calculus.
        The book <em>Functional Programming in Lean</em> by David Thrane Christiansen (https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/) will be used.
        The course will use the Lean programming language (https://lean-lang.org/).
        There is extensive community documentation available (https://leanprover-community.github.io/).

        <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
        After taking this course, you should be able to:
        <ol>
            <li>create novel languages with syntax and semantics;</li>
            <li>analyze languages and their meanings;</li>
            <li>evaluate recursive functions and inductive definitions;</li>
            <li>create functional programs;</li>
            <li>understand standard programming languages like the lambda calculus.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Grading System</h3>
        Plus/minus grading with a curve will be used for this course. The grading for this course would be based on 10-14 homeworks (15%), two midterms (20% each), a project (20%), and a final exam (25%).
        Github Classroom will be used to submit and automatically grade homework.
        Homework is pass/fail, there is no partial credit.

        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
        Students are allowed to collaborate in their project groups.
        It is expected that every student in the group is capable of explaining and solving the solution to all homework problems.
        When a group of students does collaborate, a single submission listing the name of all collaborators is preferred.
        No collaboration is allowed outside of homework assignments and the project.

        <h3>Late Policy</h3>
        Late submissions will be accepted up to 48 hours after the deadline.
        After the stated deadline, the maximum achievable score for a late assignment is 90%.
        Twenty-four (24) hours after the stated deadline, the maximum achievable score for a late assignment is 80%.
        Forty-eight (48) hours after the stated deadline, the maximum achievable score for a late assignment is 0%.
        Starting early is key, and the TA and I will be glad to help with any questions you may have on the assignments.
        Please visit us often during our office hours.
        There will be no make-up exams in general and exceptions will be rare and only for students whose reasons are included in the University's policy on "Excused Absences from Examinations".
