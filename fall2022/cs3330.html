        <h3>Description</h3>
        This course will cover introductory algorithm knowledge including: recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming, algorithms on graphs, and NP-completeness.
        The book <em>Algorithms</em> by Jeff Erickson (https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/) will be used.

        <h3>Grading System</h3>
        Plus/minus grading with a curve will be used for this course. The grading for this course would be based on 5-9 homeworks (40%), 7-14 quizzes (10%), a midterm (20%) and a final exam (30%).
        Students are asked to strictly follow the following regulations while working on their homework.
        <ol>
            <li>Write your name, section number, name of collaborators (see Collaboration) on the front page.</li>
            <li>Make sure your writing is readable by another human being.</li>
            <li>Write clearly and precisely. Sloppy answers will receive fewer points.</li>
            <li>When writing algorithms, first write in detailed prose what your algorithm does, then write pseudocode, prove correctness (if asked), and analyze the algorithm (if asked). Explanation of the algorithm with examples and figures will improve clarity.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Collaboration</h3>
        Students are allowed to collaborate in groups of two or three.
        It is expected that every student in the group is capable of explaining and solving the solution to all homework problems.
        When a group of students does collaborate, a single submission listing the name of all collaborators is preferred.
        In this case each collaborator receives the same grade based on the submission.
        If a group of students wishes to submit a homework in their own words, they must still list any other students that they collaborated with, but their submission will be graded independently.
        No collaboration is allowed outside of homework assignments.

        <h3>Late Policy</h3>
        Late submissions will be accepted up to 48 hours after the deadline.
        After the stated deadline, the maximum achievable score for a late assignment is 90%.
        Twenty-four (24) hours after the stated deadline, the maximum achievable score for a late assignment is 80%.
        Forty-eight (48) hours after the stated deadline, the maximum achievable score for a late assignment is 0%.
        Starting early is key, and the TA and I will be glad to help with any questions you may have on the assignments.
        Please visit us often during our office hours.
        There will be no make-up exams in general and exceptions will be rare and only for students whose reasons are included in the University's policy on "Excused Absences from Examinations".

        <h2>The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences: Important Policies and Procedures</h2>

        <h3>Administrative Home</h3>
        The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS) is the administrative home of this course and governs its add/drop deadlines, the second-grade-only option, and other policies.
        These policies vary by college (https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook).

        <h3>Accommodations for Disabilities</h3>
        UI is committed to an educational experience that is accessible to all students.
        A student may request academic accommodations for a disability (such as mental health, attention, learning,vision, and physical or health-related condition) by registering with Student Disability Services (SDS).
        The student should then discuss accommodations with the course instructor (https://sds.studentlife.uiowa.edu/).

        <h3>Nondiscrimination in the Classroom</h3>
        UI is committed to making the classroom a respectful and inclusive space for all people irrespective of their gender, sexual, racial, religious or other identities.
        Toward this goal, students are invited to optionally share their preferred names and pronouns with their instructors and classmates.
        The University of Iowa prohibits discrimination and harassment against individuals on the basis of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, and other identity categories set forth in the University's Human Rights policy.
        For more information, contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity at diversity@uiowa.edu or diversity.uiowa.edu.

        <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
        All undergraduates enrolled in courses offered by CLAS have, in essence, agreed to the College's Code of Academic Honesty (https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code).
        Misconduct is reported to the College, resulting in suspension or other sanctions, with sanctions communicated with the student through the UI email address.

        <h3>CLAS Final Examination Policies</h3>
        The final exam schedule for each semester is announced around the fifth week of classes; students are responsible for knowing the date, time, and place of a final exam.
        Students should not make travel plans until knowing this final exam information. No exams of any kind are allowed the week before finals.
        (https://clas.uiowa.edu/faculty/teaching-policies-resources-examination-policies.)

        <h3>Making a Complaint</h3>
        Students with a complaint should first visit with the instructor or course supervisor and then with the departmental executive officer (DEO), also known as the Chair.
        Students may then bring the concern to CLAS (https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/student-rights-responsibilities).

        <h3>Understanding Sexual Harassment</h3>
        Sexual harassment subverts the mission of the University and threatens the well-being of students, faculty, and staff.
        All members of the UI community must uphold the UI mission and contribute to a safe environment that enhances learning.
        Incidents of sexual harassment must be reported immediately. For assistance, definitions, and the full University policy, see https://osmrc.uiowa.edu/.
